Main pings contain some combination of environment data (e.g. operating system, hardware, Firefox version), measurements (e.g. max number of open tabs, time spent running in Javascript garbage collection), and events (a work in progress). We have quite a few different pings, but most of our data for Firefox Desktop comes in from main pings.\nMeasurement Types\nWhen we need to measure specific things about clients, we use probes. A single ping will send in many different probes. There are two types of probes that we are interested in here: Histograms and Scalars.\nHistograms are bucketed counts. The Histograms.json file has the definitions for all histograms, which includes the minimum, maximum, and number of buckets. Any recorded value instead just increments it's associated bucket. We have four main types of histograms:\n\nBoolean - Only two buckets, associated with true and false.\nEnumerated - Integer buckets, where usually each bucket has a label.\nLinear - Buckets are divided evenly between the minimum and maximum; e.g. [1-2] is a bucket, and so is [100-101].\nExponential - Larger valued buckets cover a larger range; e.g. [1-2] is a bucket, and so is [100-200].\n\nTo see some of these in action, take a look at the Histogram Simulator.\nScalars are simply a single value. The Scalars.yaml file has the definitions for all scalars. These values can be integers, strings, or booleans.\nTMO\nThe simplest way to start looking at probe data is in the Measurement Dashboard or the Distribution Dashboard. Using these dashboards you can compare a probes value between populations, e.g. GC_MS for 64 bit vs. 32 bit, and even track it across builds.\nThe Measurement Dashboard is a snapshot, aggregating all the data from all chosen dimensions. The Y axis is % of samples, and the X axis is the bucket. You can compare between dimensions, but it does not give you the ability to see how data is changing over time. To investigate that you must use the Evolution Dashboard.\nThe Evolution Dashboard shows how the data changes over time. Choose which statistics you'd like to plot over time, e.g. Median or 95th percentile. The Y axis is time, and the X axis is the value for whichever statistic you've chosen. This dashboard, for example, shows how GC_MS is improving from nightly 53 to nightly 56! While the median is not changing much, the 95th percentile is trending down, indicating that long garbage collections are being shortened.\nThe X axis on the Evolution Dashboard shows either Build ID (a date), or Submission Date. The difference is that on any single date we might recieve submissions from lots of builds, but aggregating by Build ID means we can be sure a change was because of a new build.\nThe second plot on the Evolution View is the number of pings we saw containing that probe (Metric Count).\nTMO Caveats\n\nData is aggregated on a per-ping basis, meaning these dashboards cannot be used to say something definitive about users. Please repeat that to yourself. A trend in the evolution view may be caused not by a change affecting lots of users, but a change affecting one user who is now sending 50% of the pings we see. And yes, that does happen.\nSometimes it looks like no data is there, but you think there should be. Check under advanced settings and check \"Don't Sanitize\" and \"Don't Trim Buckets\". If it's still not there, let us know in IRC on #telemetry.\n\nWhere to go next\n\nAnalysis using STMO\nAdvanced analysis with ATMO\nExperimental data\nAdding probes, collecting more data\nAugmenting

measurements and sent for different purposes.\nTo review a complete list of ping types and their schemata, see \nthis section of the Mozilla Source Tree Docs.\nBackground and Caveats\nThe large majority of analyses can be completed using only the\nmain ping.\nThis ping includes histograms, scalars, and other performance and diagnostic data.\nFew analyses actually rely directly on the raw ping data.\nInstead, we provide derived datasets which are processed versions of these data,\nmade to be:\n\nEasier and faster to query\nOrganized to make the data easier to analyze\nCleaned of erroneous or misleading data\n\nBefore analyzing raw ping data,\ncheck to make sure there isn't already a derived dataset made for your purpose.\nIf you do need to work with raw ping data, be aware that loading the data can take a while.\nTry to limit the size of your data by controlling the date range, etc.\nAccessing the Data\nYou can access raw ping data from an \nATMO cluster using the \nDataset API.\nRaw ping data are not available in re:dash.\nFurther Reading\nYou can find the complete ping documentation.\nTo augment our data collection, see\nCollecting New Data\nMain Ping Derived Datasets\nThe main ping\ncontains most of the measurements used to track performance and health of Firefox in the wild.\nThis ping includes histograms and scalars.\nThis section describes the derived datasets we provide to make analyzing this data easier.\nlongitudinal\nThe longitudinal dataset is a 1% sample of main ping data\norganized so that each row corresponds to a client_id.\nIf you're not sure which dataset to use for your analysis,\nthis is probably what you want.\nContents\nEach row in the longitudinal dataset represents one client_id,\nwhich is approximately a user.\nEach column represents a field from the main ping.\nMost fields contain arrays of values, with one value for each ping associated with a client_id.\nUsing arrays give you access to the raw data from each ping,\nbut can be difficult to work with from SQL.\nHere's a query showing some sample data\nto help illustrate.\nTake a look at the longitudinal examples if you get stuck.\nBackground and Caveats\nThink of the longitudinal table as wide and short.\nThe dataset contains more columns than main_summary\nand down-samples to 1% of all clients to reduce query computation time and save resources.\nIn summary, the longitudinal table differs from main_summary in two important ways:\n\nThe longitudinal dataset groups all data so that one row represents a client_id\nThe longitudinal dataset samples to 1% of all client_ids\n\nPlease note that this dataset only contains release (or opt-out) histograms and scalars.\nAccessing the Data\nThe longitudinal is available in re:dash,\nthough it can be difficult to work with the array values in SQL.\nTake a look at this example query.\nThe data is stored as a parquet table in S3 at the following address.\nSee this cookbook to get started working with the data\nin Spark.\ns3://telemetry-parquet/longitudinal/\nmain_summary\nThe main_summary table is the most direct representation of a main ping\nbut can be difficult to work with due to its size. \nPrefer the longitudinal dataset unless using the sampled data is prohibitive.\nContents\nThe main_summary table contains one row for each ping.\nEach column represents one field from the main ping payload,\nthough only a subset of all main ping fields are included.\nThis dataset does not include histograms.\nBackground and Caveats\nThis table is massive, and due to it's size, it can be difficult to work with.\nYou should avoid querying main_summary from re:dash.\nYour queries will be slow to complete and can impact performance for other users,\nsince re:dash on a shared cluster.\nInstead, we recommend using the longitudinal or cross_sectional dataset where possible.\nIf these datasets do not suffice, consider using Spark on an\nATMO cluster.\nIn the odd case where these queries are necessary,\nmake use of the sample_id field and limit to a short submission date range.\nAccessing the Data\nThe data is stored as a parquet table in S3 at the following address.\nSee this cookbook to get started working with the data in Spark.\ns3://telemetry-parquet/main_summary/v4/\nThough not recommended main_summary is accessible through re:dash. \nHere's an example query.\nYour queries will be slow to complete and can impact performance for other users,\nsince re:dash is on a shared cluster.\nFurther Reading\nThe technical documentation for main_summary is located in the\ntelemetry-batch-view documentation.\nThe code responsible for generating this dataset is \nhere\ncross_sectional\nThe cross_sectional dataset provides descriptive statistics\nfor each client_id in a 1% sample of main ping data.\nThis dataset simplifies the longitudinal table by replacing \nthe longitudinal arrays with summary statistics. \nThis is the most useful dataset for describing our user base.\nContent\nEach row in the cross_sectional dataset represents one client_id,\nwhich is approximately a user.\nEach column is a summary statistic describing the client_id.\nFor example, the longitudinal table has a row called geo_country \nwhich contains an array of country codes.\nFor the same client_id the cross_sectional table \nhas columns called geo_country_mode and geo_country_configs \ncontaining single summary statistics for \nthe modal country and the number of distinct countries in the array.\n\n\n\nclient_id\ngeo_country\ngeo_country_mode\ngeo_country_configs\n\n\n\n\n1\narray\n\"US\"\n1\n\n\n2\narray\n\"DE\"\n2\n\n\n\nBackground and Caveats\nThis table is much easier to work with than the longitudinal dataset because\nyou don't need to work with arrays.\nThis table has a limited number of pre-computed summary statistics\nso you're metric may not be included.\nNote that this dataset is a summary of the longitudinal dataset,\nso it is also a 1% sample of all client_ids.\nAll summary statistics are computed over the last 180 days,\nso this dataset can be insensitive to changes over time.\nAccessing the Data\nThe cross_sectional dataset is available in re:dash.\nHere's an example query.\nThe data is stored as a parquet table in S3 at the following address.\nSee this cookbook to get started working with the data in Spark.\ns3://telemetry-parquet/cross_sectional/v1/\nFurther Reading\nThe cross_sectional dataset is generated by \nthis code.\nTake a look at this query for a schema.\nclient_count\nThe client_count dataset is useful for estimating user counts over a few \npre-defined dimensions.\nContent\nThis dataset includes columns for a dozen factors and an HLL variable.\nThe hll column contains a\nHyperLogLog\nvariable, which is an approximation to the exact count.\nThe factor columns include activity date and the dimensions listed\nhere.\nEach row represents one combinations of the factor columns.\nBackground and Caveats\nIt's important to understand that the hll column is not a standard count.\nThe hll variable avoids double-counting users when aggregating over multiple days.\nThe HyperLogLog variable is a far more efficient way to count distinct elements of a set,\nbut comes with some complexity.\nTo find the cardinality of an HLL use cardinality(cast(hll AS HLL)).\nTo find the union of two HLL's over different dates, use merge(cast(hll AS HLL)).\nThe Firefox ER Reporting Query\nis a good example to review.\nFinally, Roberto has a relevant writeup\nhere.\nAccessing the Data\nThe data is available in re:dash.\nTake a look at this \nexample query.\nI don't recommend accessing this data from ATMO.\nFurther Reading\nheavy_users\nThe heavy_users table provides information about whether a given client_id is\nconsidered a \"heavy user\" on each day (using submission date).\nContents\nThe heavy_users table contains one row per client-day, where day is\nsubmission_date. A client has a row for a specific submission_date if\nthey were active at all in the 28 day window ending on that submission_date.\nA user is a \"heavy user\" as of day N if, for the 28 day period ending\non day N, the sum of their active_ticks is in the 90th percentile (or\nabove) of all clients during that period. For more analysis on this,\nand a discussion of new profiles, see\nthis link.\nBackground and Caveats\n\nData starts at 20170801. There is technically data in the table before\nthis, but the heavy_user column is NULL for those dates because it\nneeded to bootstrap the first 28 day window.\nBecause it is top the 10% of clients for each 28 day period, more\nthan 10% of clients active on a given submission_date will be\nconsidered heavy users. If you join with another data source\n(main_summary, for example), you may see a larger proportion of heavy\nusers than expected.\nEach day has a separate, but related, set of heavy users. Initial\ninvestigations show that approximately 97.5% of heavy users as of a\ncertain day are still considered heavy users as of the next day.\nThere is no \"fixing\" or weighting of new profiles - days before the\nprofile was created are counted as zero active_ticks. Analyses may\nneed to use the included profile_creation_date field to take this\ninto account.\n\nAccessing the Data\nThe data is available both via sql.t.m.o and Spark.\nIn Spark:\nspark.read.parquet(\"s3://telemetry-parquet/heavy_users/v1\")\n\nIn SQL:\nSELECT * FROM heavy_users LIMIT 3\n\nFurther Reading\nThe code responsible for generating this dataset is\nhere\nchurn\nThe churn dataset tracks the 7-day churn rate of telemetry profiles. This\ndataset is generally used for analyzing cohort churn across segments and time.\nContent\nChurn is the rate of attrition defined by (clients seen in week N)/(clients seen in week 0)\nfor groups of clients with some shared attributes. A group of clients with\nshared attributes is called a cohort. The cohorts in this dataset are created\nevery week and can be tracked over time using the acquisition_date and the\nweeks since acquisition or current_week.\nThe following example demonstrates the current logic for generating this\ndataset. Each column represents the days since some arbitrary starting date.\n\n\n\nclient\n00\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n\n\n\n\nA\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nAll three clients are part of the same cohort. Client A is retained for weeks 0\nand 1 since there is activity in both periods. A client only needs to show up\nonce in the period to be counted as retained. Client B is acquired in week 0 and\nis active frequently but does not appear in following weeks. Client B is\nconsidered churned on week 1. However, a client that is churned can become\nretained again. Client C is considered churned on week 1 but retained on week 3.\nThe following table summarizes the above daily activity into the following view\nwhere every column represents the current week since acquisition date..\n\n\n\nclient\n0\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\nA\nX\nX\n\n\n\nB\nX\n\n\n\n\nC\nX\n\nX\n\n\n\nThe clients are then grouped into cohorts by attributes. An attribute describes\na property about the cohort such as the country of origin or the binary\ndistribution channel. Each group also contains descriptive aggregates of\nengagement. Each metric describes the activity of a cohort such as size and\noverall usage at a given time instance.\nBackground and Caveats\n\nEach row in this dataset describes a unique segment of users\nThe number of rows is exponential with the number of dimensions\nNew fields should be added sparing to account for data-set size\n\n\nThe dataset lags by 10 days in order account for submission latency\nThis value was determined to be time for 99% of main pings to arrive at the\nserver. With the shutdown-ping sender, this has been reduced to 4 days.\nHowever, churn_v3 still tracks releases older than Firefox 55.\n\n\nThe start of the period is fixed to Sundays. Once it has been aggregated, the\nperiod cannot be shifted due to the way clients are counted.\nA supplementary 1-day retention dataset using HyperLogLog for client\ncounts is available for counting over arbitrary retention periods and date\noffsets. Additionally, calculating churn or retention over specific cohorts\nis tractable in STMO with main_summary or clients_daily datasets.\n\n\n\nAccessing the Data\nchurn is available in Redash under Athena and Presto. The data is also\navailable in parquet for consumption by columnar data engines at\ns3://telemetry-parquet/churn/v3.\nretention\nThe retention table provides client counts relevant to client retention at a\n1-day granularity. The project is tracked in Bug 1381840\nContents\nThe retention table contains a set of attribute columns used to specify a\ncohort of users and a set of metric columns to describe cohort activity. Each\nrow contains a permutation of attributes, an approximate set of clients in a\ncohort, and the aggregate engagement metrics.\nThis table uses the HyperLogLog (HLL) sketch to create an approximate set of\nclients in a cohort. HLL allows counting across overlapping cohorts in a single\npass while avoiding the problem of double counting. This data-structure has the\nbenefit of being compact and performant in the context of retention analysis,\nat the expense of precision. For example, calculating a 7-day retention period\ncan be obtained by aggregating over a week of retention data using the union\noperation. With SQL primitive, this requires a recomputation of COUNT DISTINCT\nover client_id's in the 7-day window.\nBackground and Caveats\n\nThe data starts at 2017-03-06, the merge date where Nightly started to\ntrack Firefox 55 in Mozilla-Central. However, there was\nnot a consistent view into the behavior of first session profiles until the\nnew_profile ping. This means much of the data is inaccurate\nbefore 2017-06-26.\nThis dataset uses 4-day reporting latency to aggregate at least 99% of the\ndata in a given submission date. This figure is derived from the\ntelemetry-health measurements on submission latency, with\nthe discussion in Bug 1407410. This latency metric was reduced\nFirefox 55 with the introduction of the shutdown ping-sender mechanism.\nCaution should be taken before adding new columns. Additional attribute\ncolumns will grow the number of rows exponentially.\nThe number of HLL bits chosen for this dataset is 13. This means the default\nsize of the HLL object is 2^13 bits or 1KiB. This maintains about a 1% error\non average. See this table from Algebird's HLL implementation for\nmore details.\n\nAccessing the Data\nThe data is primarily available through Redash on STMO via\nthe Presto source. This service has been configured to use predefined HLL\nfunctions.\nThe column should first be cast to the HLL type. The scalar\ncardinality() function will approximate the number of unique\nitems per HLL object. The aggregate merge() function will perform\nthe set union between all objects in a column.\nExample: Cast the count column into the appropriate type.\nSELECT cast(hll as HLL) as n_profiles_hll FROM retention\n\nCount the number of clients seen over all attribute combinations.\nSELECT cardinality(cast(hll as HLL)) FROM retention\n\nGroup-by and aggregate client counts over different release channels.\nSELECT channel, cardinality(merge(cast(hll AS HLL))\nFROM retention\nGROUP BY channel\n\nThe HyperLogLog library wrappers are available for use outside of the\nconfigured STMO environment, spark-hyperloglog and\npresto-hyperloglog.\nAlso see the client_count dataset.\nclients_daily\nThe clients_daily table is intended as the first stop for asking questions\nabout how people use Firefox. It should be easy to answer simple questions.\nEach row in the table is a (client_id, activity_date) and contains a\nnumber of aggregates about that day's activity.\nContents\nMany questions about Firefox take the form \"What did clients with\ncharacteristics X, Y, and Z do during the period S to E?\" The\nclients_daily table is aimed at answer those questions.\nBackground and Caveats\nThe rows in the table are based on activity date rather than\nsubmission date, so there is a somewhat higher\nprocessing delay than for\nsome other datasets. It is expected that the latest \"day\" available\nin this table is more than one day ago.\nAccessing the Data\nThe data is stored as a parquet table in S3 at the following address.\ns3://telemetry-parquet/clients_daily/v5/\nThe clients_daily table is accessible through re:dash using the Athena\ndata source.

As the name and URL imply, effective use of\nthis tool requires familiarity with the\nSQL query language, with which all of the\ntool's data extraction and analysis are performed.\nConcepts\nThere are three building block from which analyses in STMO are constructed:\nqueries, visualizations, and dashboards.\nQueries\nSTMO's basic unit of analysis is the query. A query is a block of SQL code that\nextracts and (optionally) transforms data from a single data source. Queries\ncan vary widely in complexity. Some queries are trivial one liners\n(e.g. SELECT * FROM tablename LIMIT 10), while others are many pages long,\nsmall programs in their own right.\nThe raw output from a query is tabular data, where each row is one set of\nreturn values for the query's output columns. A query can be run manually or it\ncan be specified to have a refresh schedule, where it will execute\nautomatically after a specified interval of time.\nVisualizations\nTabular data is great, but rarely is a grid of values the best way to make\nsense of your data. Each query can be associated with multiple visualizations,\neach visualization rendering the extracted data in some more useful\nformat. There are many visualization types, including charts (line, bar, area,\npie, etc.), counters, maps, pivot tables, and more. Each visualization type\nprovides a set of configuration parameters that allow you to specify how to map\nfrom the raw query output to the desired visualization. Some visualization types\nmake demands of the query output; a map visualization requires each row to contain\na longitude value and a latitude value, for instance.\nDashboards\nA dashboard is a collection of visualizations, combined into a single visual\npresentation for convenient perusal. A dashboard is decoupled from any\nparticular queries. While it is possible to include multiple visualizations\nfrom a single query in one dashboard, it is not required; users can add any\nvisualizations they can access to the dashboards they create.\nData Sources\nSQL provides the ability to extract and manipulate the data, but you won't get\nvery far without having some familiarity with what data is actually available,\nand how that data is structured. Each query in STMO is associated with exactly\none data source, and you have to know ahead of time which data source contains\nthe information that you need. One of the most commonly used data sources is\ncalled Athena (referring to Amazon's Athena\nquery service, on which it is built), which contains most of the data that is\nobtained from telemetry pings received from Firefox clients. The Athena\nsource is slowly replacing the Presto data source. Presto contains all of\nthe data that's exposed via Athena and more, but returns query results much\nmore slowly.\nOther available data sources include Crash-DB, Tiles, Sync Stats, Push,\nTest Pilot, ATMO, and even a re:dash metadata which connects to STMO's\nown redash database. You can learn more about the available data sets and how\nto find the one that's right for you on the Choosing a\ndataset page. If you have data set\nquestions, or would like to know if specific data is or can be made available\nin STMO, please inquire in the #datapipeline or #datatools channels on\nirc.mozilla.org.\nCreating an Example Dashboard\nThe rest of this document will take you through the process of creating a\nsimple dashboard using STMO.\nCreating A Query\nWe start by creating a query. Our first query will count the number of client\nids that we have coming from each country, for the top N countries. Clicking on\nthe 'New Query' button near the top left of the site will bring you to the\nquery editing page:\n\nFor this (and most queries where we're counting distinct client IDs) we'll want\nto use the \"client_count\" data\nset that is generated from\nFirefox telemetry pings.\n\nCheck if the data set is in Athena\nAs mentioned above, Athena is faster than Presto, but not all data sets are\nyet available in Athena. We can check to see if the one we want is available\nin the by typing \"client_count\" into the \"Search schema...\"  search box above\nthe schema browser interface to the left of the main query edit box. As of\nthis writing, alas, there are no matches for \"client_count\", which means this\ndata set is not available in Athena.\n\nVerify the data set exists in Presto\nIt's not in Athena, so now we should check to see if it's in Presto. If you\nclick on the 'Data Source' dropdown and change the selection from 'Athena' to\n'Presto' (with \"client_count\" still populating the filter input), you should\nsee that there is, in fact, a client_count data set (showing up as\n'default.client_count'), as well as a number of historical client_count data\nsets (showing up as 'default.client_count_v').\n\nIntrospect the available columns\nClicking on the \"default.client_count\" in the schema browser exposes the\ncolumns that are available in the data set. Two of the columns are of\ninterest to us for this query: country (for obvious reasons) and hll.\n\n\nThe hll column bears some explanation. \"hll\" stands for\nHyperLogLog, a sophisticated\nalgorithm that allows for the counting of extremely high numbers of items,\nsacrificing a small amount of accuracy in exchange for using much less memory\nthan a simple counting structure. The client_count data set uses the hll\ncolumn for all of its counting functionality. Converting the hll value back\nto a regular numeric value requires the use of the following magic SQL\nincantation:\n  cardinality(merge(cast(hll as HLL)))\nSo a query that extracts all of the unique country values and the count for\neach one, sorted from highest count to lowest count looks like this:\n  SELECT country,\n         cardinality(merge(cast(hll AS HLL))) AS client_count\n  FROM client_count\n  GROUP BY 1\n  ORDER BY 2 DESC\n\nIf you type that into the main query edit box and then click on the \"Execute\"\nbutton, you should see a blue bar appear below the edit box containing the text\n\"Executing query...\" followed by a timer indicating how long the query has been\nrunning. After a reasonable (for some definition of \"reasonable\", usually about\none to two minutes) amount of time the query should complete, resulting in a\ntable showing a client count value for each country. Congratulations, you've\njust created and run your first STMO query!\nNow would be a good time to click on the large \"New Query\" text near the top of\nthe page; it should turn into an edit box, allowing you to rename the\nquery. For this exercise, you should use a unique prefix (such as your name)\nfor your query name, so it will be easy to find your query later; I used\n\"rmiller:Top Countries\".\nCreating A Visualization\nNow that the query is created, we'll want to provide a simple\nvisualization. The table with results from the first query execution should be\nshowing up underneath the query edit box. Next to the TABLE heading should be\nanother heading entitled +NEW VISUALIZATION.\n\nClicking on the +NEW VISUALIZATION link should bring you to the\n\"Visualization Editor\" screen, where you can specify a visualization name (\"Top\nCountries bar chart\"), a chart type (\"Bar\"), an x-axis column (\"country\"), and\na y-axis column (\"client_count\").:\n\nAfter the GENERAL settings have been specified, we'll want to tweak a few\nmore settings on the X AXIS tab. You'll want to click on this tab and then\nchange the 'Scale' setting to 'Category', and uncheck the 'Sort Values'\ncheckbox to allow the query's sort order to take precedence:\n\nA Note About Limits\nOnce you save the visualization settings and return to the query source page,\nyou should have a nice bar graph near the bottom of the page. You may notice,\nhowever, that the graph has quite a long tail. Rather than seeing all of\nthe countries, it might be nicer to only see the top 20. We can do this by adding\na LIMIT clause to the end of our query:\n  SELECT country, cardinality(merge(cast(hll AS HLL))) AS client_count FROM client_count GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT 20\nIf you edit the query to add a limit clause and again hit the 'Execute' button,\nyou should get a new bar graph that only shows the 20 countries with the\nhighest number of unique clients. In this case, the full data set has\napproximately 250 return values, and so limiting the result count improves\nreadability. In other cases, however, an unlimited query might return thousands\nor even millions of rows. When those queries are run, readability is not the\nonly problem; queries that return millions of rows can tax the system, failing\nto return the desired results, and negatively impacting the performance of all\nof the other users of the system. Thus, a very important warning:\n  ALL QUERIES SHOULD INCLUDE A \"LIMIT\" STATEMENT BY DEFAULT!\nYou should be in the habit of adding a \"LIMIT 100\" clause to the end of all new\nqueries, to prevent your query from returning a gigantic data set that causes\nUI and performance problems. You may learn that the total result set is small\nenough that the limit is unnecessary, but unless you're certain that is the\ncase specifying an explicit LIMIT helps prevent unnecessary issues.\nQuery Parameters\nWe got our chart under control by adding a \"LIMIT 20\" clause at the end. But\nwhat if we only want the top 10? Or maybe sometimes we want to see the top 30?\nWe don't always know how many results our users will want. Is it possible to\nallow users to specify how many results they want to see?\nAs you've probably guessed, I wouldn't be asking that question if the answer\nwasn't \"yes\". STMO allows queries to accept user arguments by the use of double\ncurly-braces around a variable name. So our query now becomes the following:\n  SELECT country, cardinality(merge(cast(hll AS HLL))) AS client_count FROM client_count GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT {{country_count}}\nOnce you replace the hard coded limit value with {{country_count}} you should\nsee an input field show up directly above the bar chart. If you enter a numeric\nvalue into this input box and click on 'Execute' the query will run with the\nspecified limit. Clicking on the 'Save' button will then save the query, using\nthe entered parameter value as the default.\nCreating A Dashboard\nNow we can create a dashboard to display our visualization. Do this by clicking\non the 'Dashboards' dropdown near the top left of the page, and then clicking\nthe 'New Dashboard' option. Choose a name for your dashboard, and you will be\nbrought to a mostly empty page. Clicking on the '...' button near the top right\nof the page will give you the option to 'Add Widget'. This displays the\nfollowing dialog:\n\nThe \"Search a query by name\" field is where you can enter in the unique prefix\nused in your query name to find the query you created. This will not yet work,\nhowever, because your query isn't published. Publishing a query makes it show\nup in searches and on summary pages. Since this is only an exercise, we won't\nwant to leave our query published, but it must be published briefly in order to\nadd it to our dashboard. You can publish your query by returning to the query\nsource page and clicking the \"Publish\" button near the top right of the screen.\nOnce your query is published, it should show up in the search results when you\ntype your unique prefix into the \"Search a query by name\" field on the \"Add\nWidget\" dialog. When you select your query, a new \"Choose Visualization\"\ndropdown will appear, allowing you to choose which of the query's\nvisualizations to use. Choose the bar chart you created and then click on the\n\"Add to Dashboard\" button. Voila! Now your dashboard should have a bar chart,\nand you should be able to edit the 'country_count' value and click the refresh\nbutton to change the number of countries that show up on the chart.\nCompleting the Dashboard\nA dashboard with just one graph is a bit sad, so let's flesh it out by adding a\nhandful of additional widgets. We're going to create three more queries, each\nwith a very similar bar chart. The text of the queries will be provided here,\nbut creating the queries and the visualizations and wiring them up to the\ndashboard will be left as an exercise to the user. The queries are as follows:\n\nTop OSes (recommended os_count value == 6)\nSELECT os, cardinality(merge(cast(hll AS HLL))) AS client_count FROM client_count GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT\n\nChannel Counts\nSELECT normalized_channel AS channel, cardinality(merge(cast(hll AS HLL))) AS client_count FROM client_count GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC\n\nApp Version Counts (recommended app_version_count value == 20)\nSELECT app_name, app_version, cardinality(merge(cast(hll AS HLL))) AS client_count FROM client_count GROUP BY 1, 2 ORDER BY 3 DESC LIMIT\n\n\nCreating bar charts for these queries and adding them to the original dashboard\ncan result in a dashboard resembling this:\n\nSome final notes to help you create your dashboards:\n\nDon't forget that you'll need to publish each of your queries before you can\nadd its visualizations to your dashboard.\n\nSimilarly, it's a good idea to unpublish any test queries after you've used\nthem in a dashboard so as not to permanently pollute everyon's search results\nwith your tests and experiments. Queries that are the result of actual\nwork-related analysis should usually remain published, so others can see and\nlearn from them.\n\nThe 'Firefox' label on the 'App Version counts' graph is related to the use\nof the 'Group by' visualization setting. I encourage you to experiment with\nthe use of 'Group by' in your graphs to learn more about how this can be\nused.\n\nThis tutorial has only scratched the surface of the wide variety of very\nsophisticated visualizations supported by STMO. You can see a great many much\nmore sophisticated queries and dashboards by browsing around and exploring\nthe work that has been published by others.\n\nThe redash help center is useful for further deep\ndiving into redash and all of its capabilities.\n\n\nPrototyping Queries\nSometimes you want to start working on your query before the data is available.\nYou can do this with most of the data sources by selecting a static test data\nset, then working with it as usual. You can also use this method to explore\nhow a given SQL backend behaves.\nNote that UNION ALL will retain duplicate rows while UNION will discard them.\nHere are a couple of examples:\nSimple three-column test dataset\nWITH test AS (\n SELECT 1 AS client_id, 'foo' AS v1, 'bar' AS v2 UNION ALL\n SELECT 2 AS client_id, 'bla' AS v1, 'baz' AS v2 UNION ALL\n SELECT 3 AS client_id, 'bla' AS v1, 'bar' AS v2 UNION ALL\n SELECT 2 AS client_id, 'bla' AS v1, 'baz' AS v2 UNION ALL\n SELECT 3 AS client_id, 'bla' AS v1, 'bar' AS v2\n)\n\nSELECT * FROM test\n\nConvert a semantic version string to a sortable array field\nWITH foo AS (\n SELECT '1.0.1' AS v UNION\n SELECT '1.10.3' AS v UNION\n SELECT '1.0.2' AS v UNION\n SELECT '1.1' AS v UNION\n -- Doesn't work with these type of strings due to casting\n -- SELECT '1.3a1' AS v UNION\n SELECT '1.2.1' AS v\n)\n\nSELECT cast(split(v, '.') AS array) FROM foo ORDER BY 1\n\nHow do boolean fields get parsed from strings?\nWITH bar AS (\n SELECT '1' AS b UNION\n SELECT '0' UNION\n SELECT 't' UNION\n SELECT 'f' UNION\n SELECT 'true' UNION\n SELECT 'false' UNION\n SELECT 'turkey'\n)\nSELECT b, try(cast(b AS boolean)) from bar\n\n"},"concepts/analysis_gotchas.html":{"url":"concepts/analysis_gotchas.html","title":"Common Analysis Gotchas","keywords":"","body":"Analysis Gotchas\nWhen performing analysis on any data there are some mistakes that are easy to make and details that are easy to overlook. Do you know exactly what question you hope to answer? Is your sample representative of your population? Is your result \"real\"? How precisely can you state your conclusion?\nThis document is not about those traps. Instead, it is about quirks and pitfalls specific to Telemetry.\nPseudo-replication\nTelemetry data is a collection of pings. A single main-ping represents a single subsession. Some clients have more subsessions than others.\nSo when you say \"63% of beta 53 has Firefox set as its default browser\", make sure you specify it is 63% of pings, since it is only around 46% of clients. (Apparently users with Firefox Beta 53 set as their default browser submit more main-pings than users who don't).\nProfiles vs Users\nIn the section above you'll notice I said \"clients\" not \"users.\" That is because of all the things we're able to count, users isn't one of them.\nUsers can have multiple Firefox profiles running on the same computer at the same time (like developers).\nUsers can have the same Firefox profile running on several computers on different days of the week (also developers).\nThe only things we can count are pings and clients. Clients we can count because we send a client_id with each ping that uniquely identifies the profile from which it came. This is generally close enough to our idea of \"user\" that we can get away with counting profiles and calling them users, but you may run into some instances where the distinction matters.\nWhen in doubt, be precise. You're counting clients.\nOpt-in vs Opt-out\nWe don't collect the same information from everyone.\nEvery profile that doesn't have Telemetry disabled sends us \"opt-out\" Telemetry. This includes:\n\nNearly everything in the Environment\nSome very specific Histograms, Scalars, and Events that are marked \"releaseChannelCollection\": \"opt-out\"\n\nMost probes are \"opt-in\": we do not get information from them unless the user opts into sending us this information. Users can opt-in in two ways:\n\nUsing Firefox's Options UI to tick the box that gives us permission\nInstalling any pre-release version of Firefox\n\nThe nature of selection bias is such that the population in #1 is useless for analysis. If you want to encourage users to collect good information for us, ask them to install Beta: it's only slightly harder than finding and checking the opt-in checkbox in Firefox.\nTrusting Dates\nDon't trust client times.\nAny timestamp recorded by the user is subject to \"clock skew.\" The user's clock can be set (purposefully or accidentally) to any time at all. The nature of SSL certificates tends to keep this within a certain relatively-accurate window, because a user who's clock is too far in the past or too far in the future might confuse certain expiration-date-checking code.\nExamples of client times: crashDate, crashTime, meta/Date, sessionStartDate, subsessionStartDate, profile/creationDate\nExamples of server times you can trust: Timestamp\nDate Formats\nNot all dates and times are created equal. Most of the dates and times in Telemetry pings are ISO 8601. Most are full timestamps, though their resolution may differ from being per-second to being per-day.\nThen there's profile/creationDate which is just a number of days since epoch. Like 17177 for the date 2017-01-11.\nTip: To convert profile/creationDate to a usable date in SQL: DATE_ADD('day', profile_created, DATE '1970-01-01')\nIn derived datasets ISO dates are sometimes converted to strings in one of two formats: %Y-%m-%d or %Y%m%d.\nBuild ids look like dates but aren't. If you take the first eight characters you can use that as a proxy for the day the build was released.\nmetadata/Date is an HTTP Date header in a RFC 7231-compatible format.\nTip: To parse metadata/Date to a usable date in SQL: DATE_PARSE(SUBSTR(client_submission_date, 1, 25), '%a, %d %b %Y %H:%i:%s')\nDelays\nTelemetry data takes a while to get into our hands. The largest data mule in Telemetry is the main-ping. It is (pending bug 1336360) sent at the beginning of a client's next Firefox session. If the user shuts down their Firefox for the weekend, we won't get their Friday data until Monday morning.\nA rule of thumb (pending bug 1336360) is data from two days ago is usually fairly representative.\nIf you'd like to read more about this subject and look at pretty graphs, there are a series of blogposts

package\nnbconvert\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding a Reviewer\nThere are two major types of review for most analyses:\nData review and Methodology review.\nA data reviewer has expert understanding of the dataset your analysis is based upon.\nDuring data review, your reviewer will try to identify\nany issues with your analysis that come from misapplying the data.\nFor example, sampling issues or data collection oddities.\nMethodology review primarily covers statistical concepts.\nFor example, if you're training regressions, forecasting data, or doing complex\nstatistical tests, you should probably get Methodology review.\nMany (most?) analyses at Mozilla use simple aggregations and little to no statistical inference.\nThese analyses only require data review.\nAccordingly, we suggest you first find a data reviewer for your analysis.\nYour data reviewer will tell you if you should get methodology review\nand will help you find a reviewer.\nData Reviewers\nTo get review for your analysis,\ncontact one of the data reviewers listed for the dataset your analysis is based upon:\n\n\n\nDataset\nReviewers\n\n\n\n\nLongitudinal\n\n\n\nCross Sectional\n\n\n\nMain Summary\n\n\n\nCrash

stored as a JSON object, with python code stored in strings.\nThis makes commenting on particular lines very difficult.\nBecause the output is stored next to the code,\nit's also very difficult to review the diff for a given notebook.\nRTMO\nFor simple notebooks, the best way to get review is through the\nknowledge repo.\nThe knowledge repo renders your Jupyter notebooks to markdown\nwhile keeping the original source code next to the document.\nThis gives your reviewer an easy-to-review markdown file.\nYour analysis will also be available at\nRTMO.\nThis will aid discoverability and help others find your analysis.\nNote that RTMO is public so your analysis will also be public.\nStart a Repository\nNotebooks are great for presenting information,\nbut are not a good medium for storing code.\nIf your notebook contains complicated logic or a significant amount of custom code,\nyou should consider moving most of the logic to a python package.\nYour reviewer may ask you for tests,\nwhich also requires moving the code out of a notebook.\nWhere to store the package\nThe data platform team maintains a python repository of analyses and ETL called\npython_mozetl.\nFeel free to file a pull request against that repository.\nYour reviewer will provide analysis review during the code review.\nYou'll need review for each commit to python_mozetl's master branch.\nIf you are still prototyping your job but want to move out of a Jupyter notebook,\ntake a look at\ncookiecutter-python-etl.\nThis tool will help you configure a new python repository\nso you can hack quickly without getting review.\nnbconvert\nThe easiest way to get your code out of a Jupyter notebook\nis to use nbconvert command from Jupyter.\nIf you have a notebook called analysis.ipynb\nyou can dump your analysis to a python script using the following command:\njupyter nbconvert --to python analysis.ipynb\n\nYou'll need to clean up some formatting in the resulting analysis.py file,\nbut most of

representing\na 3-tuple of (engine, source, count). The engine field represents the name of\nthe search engine against which the searches were done. The source field represents\nthe part of the Firefox UI that was used to perform the search. It contains values\nsuch as \"abouthome\", \"urlbar\", and \"searchbar\". The count field contains the number\nof searches performed against this engine+source combination during that subsession.\nAny of the fields in the struct may be null (for example if the search key did not\nmatch the expected pattern, or if the count was non-numeric).\nThe loop_activity_counter field is a simple struct containing inner fields for each\nexpected value of the LOOP_ACTIVITY_COUNTER Enumerated Histogram. Each inner field\nis a count for that histogram bucket.\nThe popup_notification_stats field is a map of String keys to struct values,\neach field in the struct being a count for the expected values of the\nPOPUP_NOTIFICATION_STATS Keyed Enumerated Histogram.\nThe places_bookmarks_count and places_pages_count fields contain the mean\nvalue of the corresponding Histogram, which can be interpreted as the average number\nof bookmarks or pages in a given subsession.\nThe active_addons field contains an array of structs, one for each entry in\nthe environment.addons.activeAddons section of the payload. More detail in\nBug 1290181.\nThe disabled_addons_ids field contains an array of strings, one for each entry in\nthe payload.addonDetails which is not already reported in the environment.addons.activeAddons\nsection of the payload. More detail in\nBug 1390814.\nPlease note that while using this field is generally ok, this was introduced to support\nthe TAAR project and you should not count on it\nin the future. The field can stay in the main_summary, but we might need to slightly change\nthe ping structure to something better than payload.addonDetails.\nThe theme field contains a single struct in the same shape as the items in the\nactive_addons array. It contains information about the currently active browser\ntheme.\nThe user_prefs field contains a struct with values for preferences of interest.\nThe events field contains an array of event structs.\nDynamically-included histogram fields are present as key->value maps,\nor key->(key->value) nested maps for keyed histograms.\n\nCode Reference\nThis dataset is generated

invalid pings in our processing. Invalid pings are defined as those that:\n\nThe submission dates or activity dates are invalid or missing.\nThe build ID is malformed.\nThe docType field is missing or unknown.\nThe ping is a main ping without usage hours or a crash ping with usage hours.\n\nScheduling\nThe crash_aggregates job is run daily, at midnight UTC.\nThe job is scheduled on Airflow.\nThe DAG is here\nSchema\nThe crash_aggregates table has 4 commonly-used columns:\n\nsubmission_date is the date pings were submitted for a particular aggregate.\nFor example, select sum(stats['usage_hours']) from crash_aggregates where submission_date = '2016-03-15' will give the total number of user hours represented by pings submitted on March 15, 2016.\nThe dataset is partitioned by this field. Queries that limit the possible values of submission_date can run significantly faster.\n\n\nactivity_date is the day when the activity being recorded took place.\nFor example, select sum(stats['usage_hours']) from crash_aggregates where activity_date = '2016-03-15' will give the total number of user hours represented by activities that took place on March 15, 2016.\nThis can be several days before the pings are actually submitted, so it will always be before or on its corresponding submission_date.\nTherefore, queries that are sensitive to when measurements were taken on the client should prefer this field over submission_date.\n\n\ndimensions is a map of all the other dimensions that we currently care about. These fields include:\ndimensions['build_version'] is the program version, like 46.0a1.\ndimensions['build_id'] is the YYYYMMDDhhmmss timestamp the program was built, like 20160123180541. This is also known as the \"build ID\" or \"buildid\".\ndimensions['channel'] is the channel, like release or beta.\ndimensions['application'] is the program name, like Firefox or Fennec.\ndimensions['os_name'] is the name of the OS the program is running on, like Darwin or Windows_NT.\ndimensions['os_version'] is the version of the OS the program is running on.\ndimensions['architecture'] is the architecture that the program was built for (not necessarily the one it is running on).\ndimensions['country'] is the country code for the user (determined using geoIP), like US or UK.\ndimensions['experiment_id'] is the identifier of the experiment being participated in, such as e10s-beta46-noapz@experiments.mozilla.org, or null if no experiment.\ndimensions['experiment_branch'] is the branch of the experiment being participated in, such as control or experiment, or null if no experiment.\ndimensions['e10s_enabled'] is whether E10S is enabled.\ndimensions['e10s_cohort'] is the E10S cohort the user is part of, such as control, test, or disqualified.\ndimensions['gfx_compositor'] is the graphics backend compositor used by the program, such as d3d11, opengl and simple. Null values may be reported as none as well.\nAll of the above fields can potentially be blank, which means \"not present\". That means that in the actual pings, the corresponding fields were null.\n\n\nstats contains the aggregate values that we care about:\nstats['usage_hours'] is the number of user-hours represented by the aggregate.\nstats['main_crashes'] is the number of main process crashes represented by the aggregate (or just program crashes, in the non-E10S case).\nstats['content_crashes'] is the number of content process crashes represented by the aggregate.\nstats['plugin_crashes'] is the number of plugin process crashes represented by the aggregate.\nstats['gmplugin_crashes'] is the number of Gecko media plugin (often abbreviated GMPlugin) process crashes represented by the aggregate.\nstats['content_shutdown_crashes'] is the number of content process crashes that were caused by failure to shut down in a timely manner.\nstats['gpu_crashes'] is the number of gpu process crashes represented by the aggregate.\n\n\n\nTODO(harter):

This\ndataset is generally used for analyzing cohort churn across segments and time.\nContent\nChurn is the rate of attrition defined by (clients seen in week N)/(clients seen in week 0)\nfor groups of clients with some shared attributes. A group of clients with\nshared attributes is called a cohort. The cohorts in this dataset are created\nevery week and can be tracked over time using the acquisition_date and the\nweeks since acquisition or current_week.\nThe following example demonstrates the current logic for generating this\ndataset. Each column represents the days since some arbitrary starting date.\n\n\n\nclient\n00\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n\n\n\n\nA\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nAll three clients are part of the same cohort. Client A is retained for weeks 0\nand 1 since there is activity in both periods. A client only needs to show up\nonce in the period to be counted as retained. Client B is acquired in week 0 and\nis active frequently but does not appear in following weeks. Client B is\nconsidered churned on week 1. However, a client that is churned can become\nretained again. Client C is considered churned on week 1 but retained on week 3.\nThe following table summarizes the above daily activity into the following view\nwhere every column represents the current week since acquisition date..\n\n\n\nclient\n0\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\nA\nX\nX\n\n\n\nB\nX\n\n\n\n\nC\nX\n\nX\n\n\n\nThe clients are then grouped into cohorts by attributes. An attribute describes\na property about the cohort such as the country of origin or the binary\ndistribution channel. Each group also contains descriptive aggregates of\nengagement. Each metric describes the activity of a cohort such as size and\noverall usage at a given time instance.\nBackground and Caveats\n\nEach row in this dataset describes a unique segment of users\nThe number of rows is exponential with the number of dimensions\nNew fields should be added sparing to account for data-set size\n\n\nThe dataset lags by 10 days in order account for submission latency\nThis value was determined to be time for 99% of main pings to arrive at the\nserver. With the shutdown-ping sender, this has been reduced to 4 days.\nHowever, churn_v3 still tracks releases older than Firefox 55.\n\n\nThe start of the period is fixed to Sundays. Once it has been aggregated, the\nperiod cannot be shifted due to the way clients are counted.\nA supplementary 1-day retention dataset using HyperLogLog for client\ncounts is available for counting over arbitrary retention periods and date\noffsets. Additionally, calculating churn or retention over specific cohorts\nis tractable in STMO with main_summary or clients_daily datasets.\n\n\n\nAccessing the Data\nchurn is available in Redash under Athena and Presto.

The project is tracked in Bug 1381840\nContents\nThe retention table contains a set of attribute columns used to specify a\ncohort of users and a set of metric columns to describe cohort activity. Each\nrow contains a permutation of attributes, an approximate set of clients in a\ncohort, and the aggregate engagement metrics.\nThis table uses the HyperLogLog (HLL) sketch to create an approximate set of\nclients in a cohort. HLL allows counting across overlapping cohorts in a single\npass while avoiding the problem of double counting. This data-structure has the\nbenefit of being compact and performant in the context of retention analysis,\nat the expense of precision. For example, calculating a 7-day retention period\ncan be obtained by aggregating over a week of retention data using the union\noperation. With SQL primitive, this requires a recomputation of COUNT DISTINCT\nover client_id's in the 7-day window.\nBackground and Caveats\n\nThe data starts at 2017-03-06, the merge date where Nightly started to\ntrack Firefox 55 in Mozilla-Central. However, there was\nnot a consistent view into the behavior of first session profiles until the\nnew_profile ping. This means much of the data is inaccurate\nbefore 2017-06-26.\nThis dataset uses 4-day reporting latency to aggregate at least 99% of the\ndata in a given submission date. This figure is derived from the\ntelemetry-health measurements on submission latency, with\nthe discussion in Bug 1407410. This latency metric was reduced\nFirefox 55 with the introduction of the shutdown ping-sender mechanism.\nCaution should be taken before adding new columns. Additional attribute\ncolumns will grow the number of rows exponentially.\nThe number of HLL bits chosen for this dataset is 13. This means the default\nsize of the HLL object is 2^13 bits or 1KiB. This maintains about a 1% error\non average. See this table from Algebird's HLL implementation for\nmore details.\n\nAccessing the Data\nThe data is primarily available through Redash on STMO via\nthe Presto source. This service has been configured to use predefined HLL\nfunctions.\nThe column should first be cast to the HLL type. The scalar\ncardinality() function will approximate the number of unique\nitems per HLL object. The aggregate merge() function will perform\nthe set union between all objects in a column.\nExample: Cast the count column into the appropriate type.\nSELECT cast(hll as HLL) as n_profiles_hll FROM retention\n\nCount the number of clients seen over all attribute combinations.\nSELECT cardinality(cast(hll as HLL)) FROM retention\n\nGroup-by and aggregate client counts over different release channels.\nSELECT channel, cardinality(merge(cast(hll AS HLL))\nFROM retention\nGROUP BY channel\n\nThe HyperLogLog library wrappers are available for use outside of the\nconfigured STMO environment, spark-hyperloglog and\npresto-hyperloglog.\nAlso see the client_count dataset.\nData Reference\nExample Queries\nSee the Example Usage Dashboard for more usages of datasets of\nthe same shape.\nScheduling\nThe job is scheduled on Airflow on a daily basis after main_summary is run\nfor the day.

There is technically data in the table before\nthis, but the heavy_user column is NULL for those dates because it\nneeded to bootstrap the first 28 day window.\nBecause it is top the 10% of clients for each 28 day period, more\nthan 10% of clients active on a given submission_date will be\nconsidered heavy users.

Initial\ninvestigations show that approximately 97.5% of heavy users as of a\ncertain day are still considered heavy users as of the next day.\nThere is no \"fixing\" or weighting of new profiles - days before the\nprofile was created are counted as zero active_ticks.

One of the cool perks of working at Mozilla is that most of what we do is out in the open and because of that I can do more than just show you some diagram with arrows of our architecture; I can point you to the code, script & configuration that underlies it!\nTo make the examples concrete, the following description is centered around the collection of Telemetry data. The same tool-chain is used to collect, store and analyze data coming from disparate sources though, such as service logs.\n\nFirefox\nThere are different APIs and formats to collect data in Firefox, all suiting different use cases:\n\nhistograms – for recording multiple data points;\nscalars – for recording single values;\ntimings – for measuring how long operations take;\nevents – for recording time-stamped events.\n\nThese are commonly referred to as probes. Each probe must declare the collection policy it conforms to: either opt-out (aka base telemetry) or opt-in (aka extended telemetry). When adding a new measurement data-reviewers carefully inspect the probe and eventually approve the requested collection policy:\n\nopt-out (base telemetry) data is collected by default from all Firefox users; users may choose to turn this data collection off in preferences;\nopt-in (extended telemetry) data is collected from users who explicitly express a choice to help with Firefox development; this includes all users who install pre-release & testing builds, plus release users who have explicitly checked the box in preferences.\n\nA session begins when Firefox starts up and ends when it shuts down. As a session could be long-running and last weeks, it gets sliced into smaller logical units called subsessions. Each subsession generates a batch of data containing the current state of all probes collected so far, i.e. a main ping, which is sent to our servers. The main ping is just one of the many ping types we support. Developers can create their own ping types if needed.\nPings are submitted via an API that performs a HTTP POST request to our edge servers. If a ping fails to successfully submit (e.g. because of missing internet connection), Firefox will store the ping on disk and retry to send it until the maximum ping age is exceeded.\nKafka\nHTTP submissions coming in from the wild hit a load balancer and then an NGINX module. The module accepts data via a HTTP request which it wraps in a Hindsight protobuf message and forwards to two places: a Kafka cluster and a short-lived S3 bucket (landfill) which acts as a fail-safe in case there is a processing error and/or data loss within the rest of the pipeline. The deployment scripts and configuration files of NGINX and Kafka live in a private repository.\nThe data from Kafka is read from the Complex Event Processors (CEP) and the Data Warehouse Loader (DWL), both of which use Hindsight.\nHindsight\nHindsight, an open source stream processing software system developed by Mozilla as Heka’s successor, is useful for a wide variety of different tasks, such as:\n\nconverting data from one format to another;\nshipping data from one location to another;\nperforming real time analysis, graphing, and anomaly detection.\n\nHindsight’s core is a lightweight data processing kernel written in C that controls a set of Lua plugins executed inside a sandbox.\nThe CEP are custom plugins that are created, configured and deployed from an UI which produce real-time plots like the number of pings matching a certain criteria.  Mozilla employees can access the UI and create/deploy their own custom plugin in real-time without interfering with other plugins running.\n\nThe DWL is composed of a set of plugins that transform, convert & finally shovel pings into S3 for long term storage. In the specific case of Telemetry data, an input plugin reads pings from Kafka, pre-processes them and sends batches to S3, our data lake, for long term storage. The data is compressed and partitioned by a set of dimensions, like date and application.\nThe data has traditionally been serialized to Protobuf sequence files which contain some nasty “free-form” JSON fields. Hindsight gained recently the ability to dump data directly in Parquet form though.\nThe deployment scripts and configuration files of the CEP & DWL live in a private repository.\nSpark\nOnce the data reaches our data lake on S3 it can be processed with Spark. We provide a portal (ATMO) that allows Mozilla employees to create their own Spark cluster pre-loaded with a set of libraries & tools, like jupyter, numpy, scipy, pandas etc., and an API to conveniently read data stored in Protobuf form on S3 in a Spark RDD using a ORM-like interface. Behind the scenes we use EMR to create Spark clusters, which are then monitored by ATMO.\n\nATMO is mainly used to write custom ad-hoc analyses; since our users aren’t necessary data engineers/scientists we chose Python as the main supported language to interface with Spark. From ATMO it’s also possible to schedule periodic notebook runs and inspect the results from a web UI.\nAs mentioned earlier, most of our data lake contains data serialized to Protobuf with free-form JSON fields. Needless to say, parsing JSON is terribly slow when ingesting TBs of data per day. A set of ETL jobs, written in Scala by Data Engineers and scheduled with Airflow, create Parquet views of our raw data. We have a Github repository telemetry-batch-view that showcases this.\nA dedicated Spark job feeds daily aggregates to a Postgres database which powers a HTTP service to easily retrieve faceted roll-ups. The service is mainly used by TMO, a dashboard that visualizes distributions and time-series, and cerberus, an anomaly detection tool that detects and alerts developers of changes in the distributions. Originally the sole purpose of the Telemetry pipeline was to feed data into this dashboard but in time its scope and flexibility grew to support more general use-cases.\n\nPresto & re:dash\nWe maintain a couple of Presto clusters and a centralized Hive metastore to query Parquet data with SQL. The Hive metastore provides an universal view of our Parquet dataset to both Spark and Presto clusters.\nPresto, and other databases, are behind a re:dash service (STMO) which provides a convenient & powerful interface to query SQL engines and build dashboards that can be shared within the company. Mozilla maintains its own fork of re:dash to iterate quickly on new features, but as good open source citizen we push our changes upstream.\n\nHBase\nWe use HBase to store the history of pings by client. It’s a relatively new addition and it provides support for fast needle-in-haystack queries.\nIs that it?\nNo, not really. For example, the DWL pushes some of the Telemetry data to Redshift and Elasticsearch but those tools satisfy more niche needs. The pipeline ingests logs from services as well and there are many specialized dashboards out there I haven’t mentioned. We also use Zeppelin as a means to create interactive data analysis notebooks that supports Spark, SQL, Scala and more.\nThere is a vast ecosystem of tools for processing data at scale, each with their pros & cons. The pipeline grew organically and we added new tools as new use-cases came up that we couldn’t solve with our existing stack. There are still scars left from that growth though which require some effort to get rid of, like ingesting data from schema-less format.\n"},"tools/interfaces.html":{"url":"tools/interfaces.html","title":"Interfaces","keywords":"","body":"Mozilla Firefox Data Analysis Tools\nThis is a starting point for making sense of (and gaining access to) all of the\nFirefox-related data analysis tools.

Requires Python or Scala\nprogramming skills and knowledge of various data APIs. Learn more by visiting\nthe documentation or\ntutorials.\ntelemetry.mozilla.org (TMO)\nOur telemetry.mozilla.org (TMO) site is the\n'venerable standby' of Firefox telemetry analysis tools. It uses aggregate\ntelemetry data (as opposed to the collated data sets that are exposed to most\nof the other tools) so it provides less latency than most but is unsuitable for\nexamining at the individual client level. It provides a powerful UI that allows\nfor sophisticated ad-hoc analysis without the need for any specialized\nprogramming skills, but with so many options the UI can be a bit intimidating\nfor novice users.\nDistribution Viewer\nDistribution Viewer is a simple tool\nthat provides a set of cumulative distribution\ngraphs\nfor a pre-specified selection of Firefox user metrics. These metrics are\nextracted from a 1% sample of the clientIds from Unified Telemetry. These plots\nwill allow you to understand how values of different metrics are spread out\namong our population of users rather than just using a one number summary (such\nas a mean or median). By viewing the entire distribution, you can get a sense\nof the importance of behavior at the extremes as well as anomalies within the\npopulation that might indicate interesting behavior. Very simple to use (no\nprogramming required) and able to provide interesting insights, but not usually\nsuitable for ad-hoc analysis.\nReal Time / CEP\nThe 'real time' or 'complex event processing' (CEP)\nsystem is part of the ingestion\ninfrastructure that processes all of our Firefox telemetry data.

As a CEP system, it is unlike the rest\nof our analysis tools in that it is up to the analyst to specify and maintain\nstate from the data that is flowing; it is non-trivial to revisit older data\nthat has already passed through the system. The CEP is very powerful, allowing\nfor sophisticated monitoring, alerting, reporting, and dashboarding.

APIs are available in Python, Scala, and\nJava. The Jupyter notebook utilizes the Python API. In a nutshell, it\nprovides a way to run functional code (e.g. map, reduce, etc.) on large,\ndistributed data.\nCheck out \nSpark Best Practices\nfor tips on using Spark to it's full capabilities.\nSparkContext (sc)\nAccess to the Spark API is provided through SparkContext. In the Jupyter\nnotebook, this is the `sc` object. For example, to create a\ndistributed RDD of monotonically increasing numbers 1-1000:\nnumbers = range(1000)\n#no need to initialize sc in the Jupyter notebook\nnumsRdd = sc.parallelize(numbers)\nnums.take(10) #no guaranteed order\n\nSpark RDD\nThe Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) is Spark's basic data structure.\nThe operations that are performed on these structures are distributed to\nthe cluster. Only certain actions (such as collect() or take(N)) pull an\nRDD in locally.\nRDD's are nice because there is no imposed schema - whatever they\ncontain, they distribute around the cluster. Additionally, RDD's can be\ncached in memory, which can greatly improve performance of some\nalgorithms that need access to data over and over again.\nAdditionally, RDD operations are all part of a directed, acyclic graph.\nThis gives increased redundancy, since Spark is always able to recreate\nan RDD from the base data (by rerunning the graph), but also provides\nlazy evaluation. No computation is performed while an RDD is just being\ntransformed (a la map), but when an action is taken (e.g. reduce, take)\nthe entire computation graph is evaluated. Continuing from our previous\nexample, the following gives some of the peaks of a sin wave:\nimport numpy as np\n#no computation is performed on the following line!\nsin_values = numsRdd.map(lambda x : np.float(x) / 10).map(lambda x : (x, np.sin(x)))\n#now the entire computation graph is evaluated\nsin_values.takeOrdered(5, lambda x : -x[1])\n\nFor jumping into working with Spark RDD's, we recommend reading the\nSpark Programming Guide.\nSpark SQL and Spark Dataframes/Datasets\nSpark also supports traditional SQL, along with special data structures\nthat require schemas. The Spark SQL API can be accessed with the\n`spark` object. For example:\nlongitudinal = spark.sql('SELECT * FROM longitudinal')\ncreates a DataFrame that contains all the longitudinal data. A Spark\nDataFrame is essentially a distributed table, a la Pandas or R\nDataframes. Under the covers they are an RDD of Row objects, and thus\nthe entirety of the RDD API is available for DataFrames, as well as a\nDataFrame specific API. For example, a sql-like way to get the count of\na specific OS:\nlongitudinal.select(\"os\").where(\"os = 'Darwin'\").count()\nTo Transform the DataFrame object to an RDD, simply do:\nlongitudinal_rdd = longitudinal.rdd\nIn general, however, the DataFrames are performance optimized, so it's\nworth the effort to learn the DataFrame API.\nFor more overview, see the \nSQL Programming Guide.\nSee also the \nLongitudinal Tutorial,\none of the available example notebooks when you start a cluster.\nAvailable Data Sources for SparkSQL\nFor information about available queryable data sources (e.g.  Longitudinal dataset), \nsee \nChoosing a Dataset.\nThese datasets are optimized for fast access, and will far out-perform\nanalysis on the raw telemetry ping data.\nAccessing the Spark UI\nGo to https://localhost:8888/spark after ssh-ing into the spark cluster\nto see the Spark UI.\nIt has information about job statuses and task completion,\nand may help you debug your job.\nThe MozTelemetry Library\nWe have provided a library that gives easy access to the raw telemetry ping data.\nFor example usage, see the \nTelemetry Hello World\nexample notebook.\nDetailed documentation for the library can be found at the \nPython MozTelemetry Documentation.\nUsing the Raw Ping Data\nFirst off, import the moztelemetry library using the following:\nfrom moztelemetry import get_pings\nIf you need any other functions, just comma separate them with\nget_pings.\nThe ping data is an RDD of JSON elements. For example, using the\nfollowing:\npings = get_pings(sc, app=\"Firefox\", channel=\"nightly\", build_id=(\"20160901000000\", \"20160901999999\"), fraction=0.01)\n\nreturns an RDD of 1/100th of Firefox Nightly JSON pings for all builds\nfrom September 1 2016. Now, because it's JSON, pings are easy to access.\nFor example, to get the count of each OS type:\nos_names = pings.map(lambda x : (x['environment']['system']['os']['name'], 1))`\\\nos_counts = os_names.reduceByKey(lambda x, y : x+y)`\\\nos_counts.collect()`\n\nAlternatively, moztelemetry provides the `get_pings_properties`\nfunction, which will gather the data for you:\nsubset = get_pings_properties(pings, [\"environment/system/os/name\"])`\\\nsubset.map(lambda x : (x[\"environment/system/os/name\"], 1)).reduceByKey(lambda x, y : x+y).collect()`\n\nFAQ\nPlease add more FAQ as questions are answered by you or for you.\nHow can I load parquet datasets in a Jupyter notebook?\nUse spark.read.parquet, e.g.:\ndataset = spark.read.parquet(\"s3://the_bucket/the_prefix/the_version\")`\n\nFor more information see\nWorking with Parquet.\nI got a REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED! error\nAWS recycles hostnames, so this warning is expected.\nRemoving the offending key from $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts will remove the warning.\nYou can find the line to remove by finding the line in the output that says\nOffending key in /path/to/hosts/known_hosts:2\nWhere 2 is the line number of the key that can be deleted.\nJust remove that line, save the file, and try again.\nWhy is my notebook hanging?\nThere are a few common causes for this:\n\nCurrently, our Spark notebooks can only run a single Python kernel at\na time. If you open multiple notebooks on the same cluster and try to\nrun both, the second notebook will hang. Be sure to close notebooks\nusing \"Close and Halt\" under the \"File\" dropdown.\nThe connection from PySpark to the Spark driver might be lost.\nUnfortunately the best way to recover from this for the moment seems to\nbe spinning up a new cluster.\nCanceling execution of a notebook cell doesn't cancel any spark jobs\nthat might be running in the background. If your spark commands seem to\nbe hanging, try running `sc.cancelAllJobs()`.\n\nHow can I keep running after closing the notebook?\nFor long-running computation, it might be nice to close the notebook\n(and the ssh session) and look at the results later.\nUnfortunately, all cell output will be lost when a notebook is closed\n(for the running cell).\nTo alleviate this, there are a few options:\n\nHave everything output to a variable. These values should still be\navailable when you reconnect.\nPut %%capture at the beginning of the cell to store all output. \nSee the documentation.\n\nHow do I load an external library into the cluster?\nAssuming you've got a url for the repo, you can create an egg for it\nthis way:\n!git clone `` && cd `` && python setup.py bdist_egg`\\\nsc.addPyFile('``/dist/my-egg-file.egg')`\n\nAlternately, you could just create that egg locally, upload it to a web\nserver, then download and install it:\nimport requests`\\\nr = requests.get('``')`\\\nwith open('mylibrary.egg', 'wb') as f:`\\\n  f.write(r.content)`\\\nsc.addPyFile('mylibrary.egg')`\n\nYou will want to do this before you load the library. If the library\nis already loaded, restart the kernel in the ipython notebook.\n"},"cookbooks/realtime_analysis_plugin.html":{"url":"cookbooks/realtime_analysis_plugin.html","title":"Creating a Real-time Analysis Plugin","keywords":"","body":"Creating a Real-time Analysis Plugin\nGetting Started\nCreating an analysis plugin consists of three steps:\n\nWriting a message matcher\nThe message matcher allows one to select specific data from the data stream.\n\nWriting the analysis code/business logic\nThe analysis code allows one to aggregrate, detect anomalies, apply machine\nlearning algorithms etc.\n\nWriting the output code\nThe output code allows one to structure the analysis results in an easy to\nconsume format.\n\n\nStep by Step Setup\n\nGo to the CEP site: https://pipeline-cep.prod.mozaws.net/\n\nLogin/Register using your Google @mozilla.com account\n\nClick on the Plugin Deployment tab\n\nCreate a message matcher\n\nEdit the message_matcher variable in the Heka Analysis Plugin Configuration\ntext area.

It comes in two pieces:\nCerberus the Detector and\nMedusa the Front-end.\nCerberus\nEvery day Cerberus grabs the latest aggregated information about all\nnon-keyed Telemetry probes from aggregates.telemetry.mozilla.org and\ncompares the distribution of values from the Nightly builds of the\npast two days to the distribution of values from the Nightly builds of\nthe past seven days.\nIt does this by calculating the Bhattacharyya\ndistance between\nthe two distributions and guessing whether or not they are significant\nand\nnarrow.\nIt places all detected changes in a file for ingestion by Medusa.\nMedusa\nMedusa is in charge of emailing people when distributions change and for\ndisplaying the website https://alerts.telemetry.mozilla.org which\ncontains pertinent information about each detected regression.\nMedusa also checks for expiring histograms and sends emails notifying of\ntheir expiry.\nWhat it can do\nTelemetry Alerts is very good at identifying sudden changes in the\nshapes of normalized distributions of Telemetry probes. If you can see\nthe distribution of GC_MS shift from one day\nto the next, then likely so can Cerberus.\nWhat can't it do\nTelemetry Alerts is not able to see sudden shifts in volume. It is also\nvery easily fooled if a change happens over a long period of time or\ndoesn't fundamentally alter the shape of the probe's histogram.\nSo if you have a probe like\nSCALARS_BROWSER.ENGAGEMENT.MAX_CONCURRENT_TAB_COUNT,\nCerberus won't notice if:\n\nThe number of pings reporting this value decreased in half, but\notherwise reported the same spread of numbers\nThe value increases very slowly over time (which I'd expect it to do\ngiven how good Session Restore is these days)\nWe suddenly received twice as many pings from 200-tab subsessions\n(the dominance of 1-tab pings would likely ensure the overall shape\nof the distribution changed insufficiently much for Cerberus to pick\nup on it)\n\nTelemetry Alert Emails\nOne of the main ways humans interact with Telemetry Alerts is through\nthe emails sent by Medusa.\nAt present the email contains a link to the alert's page on\nhttps://alerts.telemetry.mozilla.org and a link to a pushlog on\nhttps://hg.mozilla.org detailing the changes newly-present in the\nNightly build that exhibited the change.\nTriaging a Telemetry Alert Email\nCongratulations! You have just received a Telemetry Alert!\nNow what?\nAssumption: Alerts happen because of changes in probes. Changes in\nprobes happen because of changes in related code. If we can identify the\ncode change, we can find the bug that introduced the code change. If we\ncan find the bug, we can ni? the person who made the change.\nGoal: Identify the human responsible for the Alert so they can\nidentify if it is\ngood/bad/intentional/exceptional/temporary/permanent/still\nrelevant/having its alerts properly looked after.\nGuide:\n1. Is this alert just one of a group of similar changes by topic? By\nbuild?\n\nIf there's a group by topic (SPDY, URLCLASSIFIER, ...) check to see\nif the changes are similar in direction/magnitude. They usually are.\nIf there's a group by build but not topic, maybe a large merge\nkicked things over. Unfortunate, as that'll make finding the source\nmore difficult.\n\n2. Open the hg.mozilla.org and alerts.telemetry.mozilla.org links in\ntabs\n\nOn alerts.tmo, does it look like an improvement or regression? (This\nis just a first idea and might change. There are often extenuating\ncircumstances that make something that looks bad into an\nimprovement, and vice versa.)\nOn hg.mo, does the topic of the changed probe exist in the pushlog?\nIn other words, does any part of the probe's name show up in the\nsummaries of any of the commits?\n\n3. From alerts.tmo, open the https://telemetry.mozilla.org link by\nclicking on the plot's title. Open another tab to the Evolution View.\n\nIs the change temporary? (might've been noticed elsewhere and\nbacked out)\nIs the change up or down?\nHas it happened before?\nWas it accompanied by a decrease in submission volume? (the second\ngraph at the bottom of the Evolution View)\nOn the Distribution View, did the Sample Count increase? Decrease?\n(this signifies that the change could be because of the addition or\nsubtraction of a population of values. For instance, we could\nsuddenly stop sending 0 values which would shift the graph to\nthe right. This could be a good thing (we're not handling useless\nthings anymore) a bad thing (something broke and we're no longer\nmeasuring the same thing we used to measure) or indifferent)\n\n4. If you still don't have a cause\n\nUse DXR or searchfox to find where the probe is accumulated.\nClick \"Log\" in that view.\nAre there any changesets in the resultant hg.mo list that ended up\nin the build we received the Alert for?\n\n5. If you _still_ don't know what's going on\n\nfind a domain expert on IRC and bother them to help you out. Domain\nknowledge is awesome.\n\nFrom pursuing these steps or substeps you should now have two things: a\nbug that likely caused the alert, and an idea of what the alert is\nabout.\nNow comment on the bug. Feel free to use this script:\nThis bug may have contributed to a sudden change in the Telemetry probe [1] which seems to have occurred in Nightly [2][3].\n\nThere was a .\nThis might mean \n\nIs this an improvement? A regression?\n\nIs this intentional? Is this expected?\n\nIs this probe still measuring something useful?\n\n[1]: \n[2]: \n[3]: \n\nThen ni? the person who pushed the change. Reply-all to the\ndev-telemetry-alerts mail with a link to the bug and some short notes on\nwhat you found.\nFrom here the user on ni? should get back to you in fairly short order\nand either help you find the real bug that caused it, or help explain\nwhat the Alert was all about. More often than not it is an expected\nchange from a probe that is still operating correctly and there is no\naction to take...\n...except making sure you never have to respond to an Alert for this\nprobe again, that is. File a bug in that bug's component to update the\nAlert'ing probe to have a valid, monitored \"alert_emails\" field so that\nthe next time it misbehaves they can be the ones to explain themselves\nwithout you having to spend all this time tracking them down.\n"},"cookbooks/":{"url":"cookbooks/","title":"Cookbooks","keywords":"","body":"Cookbooks\n"},"cookbooks/parquet.html":{"url":"cookbooks/parquet.html","title":"Working with Parquet Data on ATMO Clusters","keywords":"","body":"Working with Parquet\nThis guide will give you a quick introduction to working with \nParquet files at Mozilla.\nYou can also refer to Spark's documentation on the subject\nhere.\nMost of our derived datasets,\nlike the longitudinal or main_summary tables,\nare stored in Parquet files.\nYou can access these datasets in re:dash,\nbut you may want to access the data from an\nATMO cluster\nif SQL isn't powerful enough for your analysis\nor if a sample of the data will not suffice.\nTable of Contents\n\n\nReading Parquet Tables\nWriting Parquet Tables\nWhere to save data\nHow to save data\n\n\nAccessing Parquet Tables from Re:dash\n\n\nReading Parquet Tables\nSpark provides native support for reading parquet files.\nThe result of loading a parquet file is a \nDataFrame.\nFor example, you can load main_summary with the following snippet:\n# Parquet files are self-describing so the schema is preserved.\nmain_summary = spark.read.parquet('s3://telemetry-parquet/main_summary/v1/')\n\nYou can find the S3 path for common datasets in\nChoosing a Dataset\nor in the reference documentation.\nWriting Parquet Tables\nSaving a table to parquet is a great way to share an intermediate dataset.\nWhere to save data\nYou can save data to a subdirectory of the following bucket: \ns3://net-mozaws-prod-us-west-2-pipeline-analysis//\nUse your username for the subdirectory name.\nThis bucket is available to all ATMO clusters and Airflow.\nWhen your analysis is production ready,\nopen a PR against python_mozetl.\nHow to save data\nYou can save the dataframe test_dataframe\n to the telemetry-test-bucket with the following command:\ntest_dataframe.write.mode('error') \\\n    .parquet('s3://telemetry-test-bucket/my_subdir/table_name')\n\nAccessing Parquet Tables from Re:dash\nSee Creating a custom re:dash dataset.\n"},"cookbooks/create_a_dataset.html":{"url":"cookbooks/create_a_dataset.html","title":"Creating a custom re:dash dataset","keywords":"","body":"Creating Your Own Dataset to Query in re:dash\n\nCreate a spark notebook that does the transformations you need, either on\nraw data (using Dataset API) or on parquet data\nOutput the results of that to an s3 location, usually\ntelemetry-parquet/user/$YOUR_DATASET/v$VERSION_NUMBER/submission_date=$YESTERDAY/.\nThis would partition by submission_date, meaning each day this runs and is\noutputted to a new location in s3.

If you're not sure which\ndataset to use for your query, this is probably what you want. It differs from\nthe main_summary table in two important ways:\n\nThe longitudinal dataset groups all data for a client-id in the same row.\nThis makes it easy to report profile level metrics. Without this deduping,\nmetrics would be weighted by the number of submissions instead of by clients.\nThe dataset uses a 1% of all recent profiles, which will reduce query\ncomputation time and save resources. The sample of clients will be stable over\ntime.\n\nAccordingly, one should prefer using the Longitudinal dataset except in the\nrare case where a 100% sample is strictly necessary.\nAs discussed in the Longitudinal Data Set Example Notebook:\nThe longitudinal dataset is logically organized as a table where rows\nrepresent profiles and columns the various metrics (e.g. startup time). Each\nfield of the table contains a list of values, one per Telemetry submission\nreceived for that profile. [...]\n\nThe current version of the longitudinal dataset has been build with all\nmain pings received from 1% of profiles across all channels with [...] up to\n180 days of data.\nTable structure\nTo get an overview of the longitudinal data table:\nDESCRIBE longitudinal\n\nThat table has a row for each client, with columns for the different\nparts of the ping. There are a lot of fields here, so I recommend\ndownloading the results as a CSV if you want to search through these\nfields. Unfortunately, there's no way to filter the output of DESCRIBE\nin Presto.\nBecause this table combines all rows for a given client id, most columns\ncontain either Arrays or Maps (described below). A few properties are\ndirectly available to query on:\nSELECT count(*) AS count\nFROM longitudinal\nWHERE os = 'Linux'\n\nArrays\nMost properties are arrays, which contain one entry for each submission\nfrom a given client (newest first). Note that indexing starts at 1:\nSELECT reason[1] AS newest_reason\nFROM longitudinal\nWHERE os = 'Linux'\n\nTo expand arrays and maps and work on the data row-wise we can use\nUNNEST(array).\nWITH lengths AS\n  (SELECT os, greatest(-1, least(31, sl / (24*60*60))) AS days\n   FROM longitudinal\n   CROSS JOIN UNNEST(session_length, reason) AS t(sl, r)\n   WHERE r = 'shutdown' OR r = 'aborted-session')\nSELECT os, days, count(*) AS count\nFROM lengths\nGROUP BY days, os ORDER BY days ASC\n\nHowever, it may be better to use a sample from the main_summary table\ninstead.\nLinks:\n\nDocumentation on array\nfunctions\nUNNEST\ndocumentation\n\nMaps\nSome fields like active_addons or user_prefs are handled as maps, on\nwhich you can use the [] operator and special functions:\nWITH adp AS\n  (SELECT active_addons[1]['{d10d0bf8-f5b5-c8b4-a8b2-2b9879e08c5d}']\n            IS NOT null AS has_adblockplus\n   FROM longitudinal)\nSELECT has_adblockplus, count(*) AS count\nFROM adp GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC\n\nLinks:\n\nDocumentation on map\nfunctions\n\nSampling\nWhile composing queries, it can be helpful to work on small samples to\nreduce query runtimes:\nSELECT * FROM longitudinal LIMIT 1000 ...\n\nThere's no need to use other sampling methods, such as TABLESAMPLE, on\nthe longitudinal set. Rows are randomly ordered, so a LIMIT sample is\nexpected to be random.\nExample Queries\nBlocklist URLs (extensions.blocklist.url)\nSELECT bl, COUNT(bl)\nFROM\n  (SELECT element_at(settings, 1).user_prefs['extensions.blocklist.url'] AS bl\n   FROM longitudinal)\nGROUP BY bl\n\nBlocklist enabled/disabled (extensions.blocklist.enabled) count:\nSELECT bl, COUNT(bl)\nFROM\n  (SELECT element_at(settings, 1).blocklist_enabled AS bl\n   FROM longitudinal)\nGROUP BY bl\n\nParsing most recent submission_date\nSELECT DATE_PARSE(submission_date[1], '%Y-%m-%dT00:00:00.000Z') as parsed_submission_date\nFROM longitudinal\n\nLimiting to most recent ping in the last 7 days\nSELECT * FROM longitudinal\nWHERE DATE_DIFF('day', DATE_PARSE(submission_date[1], '%Y-%m-%dT00:00:00.000Z'), current_date) \nScalar measurement (how many users with more than 100 tabs)\nWITH samples AS\n (SELECT\n   client_id,\n   normalized_channel as channel,\n   mctc.value AS max_concurrent_tabs\n  FROM longitudinal\n  CROSS JOIN UNNEST(scalar_parent_browser_engagement_max_concurrent_tab_count) as t (mctc)\n  WHERE\n   scalar_parent_browser_engagement_max_concurrent_tab_count is not null and\n   mctc.value is not null and\n   normalized_channel = 'nightly')\nSELECT approx_distinct(client_id) FROM samples WHERE max_concurrent_tabs > 100\n\nUsing Views\nIf you find yourself copy/pasting SQL between different queries,\nconsider using a Presto VIEW to allow for code reuse. Views create\nlogical tables which you can reuse in other queries. For example, this\nview defines some\nimportant filters and derived variables which are then used in this\ndownstream\nquery.\nYou can define a view by prefixing your query with\nCREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS ...\n\nBe careful not to overwrite an existing view!

The\ncardinality operator can count the number of uid's associated with each color.\n>>> example.select($\"color\", HllCardinality($\"hll\").alias(\"count\")).show()\n+-----|-----+\n|color|count|\n+-----|-----+\n|  red|    2|\n| blue|    2|\n+-----|-----+\n\nWe can also write this query in the %sql interpreter.\n%dep sql\n\nSELECT color, hll_cardinality(hll_merge(hll)) as count\nFROM example\nGROUP BY color\n\nFinally, note that the color HLL sets have an overlapping uid. We obtain the\ncount of uids and avoid double counting by merging the sets.\n>>> example.groupBy().agg(HllCardinality(HllMerge($\"hll\")).alias(\"count\")).show()\n+-----+\n|count|\n+-----+\n|    3|\n+-----+\n\n"},"meta/contributing.html":{"url":"meta/contributing.html","title":"Contributing","keywords":"","body":"Contributing\nDocumentation is critical to making a usable data platform.\nWhen surveying our users,\ntheir most common complain has been our lack of documentation.\nIt's important that we improve our documentation as often as possible.\nGetting the Raw Documentation\nThe documentation is intended to be read as HTML at \ndocs.telemetry.mozilla.org.\nHowever, we store the documentation in raw text files in the\nfirefox-data-docs repo.\nTo begin contributing to the docs, fork the firefox-data-docs repo.\nBuilding the Documentation\nThe documentation is rendered with Gitbook\nTo build the documentation locally,\nyou'll need to install the gitbook-cli app with \nnpm:\nnpm install gitbook-cli -g\n\nand install the gitbook plugins with:\ngitbook install\n\nYou can then serve the documentation locally with:\ngitbook serve\nThe complete documentation for the gitbook toolchain is at: https://toolchain.gitbook.com/.\nIf you run into any technical limitations, let me (@harterrt) know.\nI'm happy to change the tooling to make it as much fun as possible to write.\nAdding a new article\nBe sure to link to your new article from SUMMARY.md, or GitBook will not render the file.\nThis documentation is under active development,\nso we may already be working on the documentation you need.\nTake a look at\nthis bug component\nto check.\nStyle Guide\nArticles should be written in\nMarkdown\n(not AsciiDoc).\nMarkdown is usually powerful enough and is a more common technology than Asciidoc.\nLimit lines to 100 characters where possible.\nTry to split lines at the end of sentences.\nThis makes it easier to reorganize your thoughts later.\nThis documentation is meant to be read digitally.\nKeep in mind that people read digital content much differently than other media.\nSpecifically, readers are going to skim your writing,\nso make it easy to identify important information.\nUse visual markup like bold text, code blocks, and section headers.\nAvoid long paragraphs.\nShort paragraphs that describe one concept each makes finding important information easier.\nReview\nOnce you're happy with your contribution, please open a PR and flag @harterrt for review.\nPlease squash your changes  into meaningful commits  and follow these\ncommit message guidelines.\nPublishing\nThe documentation is hosted on Github Pages.\nUpdates to the documentation still need to be pushed manually.\nUse the deploy script\nto publish new changes.\nThis script depends on \nghp-import.\nKeep in mind that this will deploy the docs to your origin repo.\nIf you're working from a fork (which you should be),\ndeploy.sh will update the docs hosted from your fork - not the production docs.\nColophon\nThis document's structure is heavily influenced by\nDjango's Documentation Style Guide.\nYou can find more context for this document in\nthis blog post.\n"},"meta/structure.html":{"url":"meta/structure.html","title":"Structure","keywords":"","body":"Documentation Structure\nThe directory structure is meant to feel comfortable for those intimately \nfamiliar with the data platform:\n.\n|--datasets - contains dataset level documentation\n|--tools - contains tool level documentation\n|--concepts - contains tutorials meant to introduce a new concept to the reader\n|--cookbooks - focused code examples for reference\nThe prose documentation is meant to take the reader from neophyte to expert.\nTo this end, the rendered documentation has an order different from the directory structure:\n\nGetting Started: Get some simple analysis completed so the user understands\nthe amount of work involved / what the product feels like\nTutorials\nData Tutorials: tutorials meant to give the reader a complete understanding\nof a specific dataset.
