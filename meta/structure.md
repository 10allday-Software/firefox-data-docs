# Documentation Structure

The directory structure is meant to feel comfortable for those intimately 
familiar with the data platform:

```
.
|--datasets - contains dataset level documentation
|--tools - contains tool level documentation
|--concepts - contains tutorials meant to introduce a new concept to the reader
|--cookbooks - focused code examples for reference
```
